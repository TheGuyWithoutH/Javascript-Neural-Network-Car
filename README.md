# Javascript-Neural-Network-Car

This is a project of simple MultiLayer Perceptron Car simulated in 2D. The entire code base is in javascript, and uses no ML libraries.

This was made thanks to the course [Self-Driving Car with JavaScript](https://youtu.be/Rs_rAxEsAvI) made by [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org). I am now and then improving this demo to make it more complex.
